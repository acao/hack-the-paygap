        Opportunity is thought of as:
      </p>
    -->

      <ul>
        <li>Women are paid just 79 cents for every dollar a man is paid.</li>
        <li>For women of color itâ€™s even worse: 60 and 55 cents for African American and Latina women, respectively.</li>
        <li>Women are overrepresented in the lowest wage professions.</li>
        <li>Motherhood is associated with a wage penalty and lower future career earnings.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In early 2016, the White House, the U.S. Census Bureau, and the U.S. Department Housing and Urban Development facilitated a process in which tech developers worked with subject matter experts and cities to build digital tools that help families, community leaders, local officials, and the media to access what they need to thrive.
      </p>
      <p>This effort culminated with a White House demo on March 7.</p>
