paragraphs:
  - "Diane works as a manager of a service center for a major mortgage lender in the suburbs of Atlanta.  Diane is a mother of two high school kids and has a husband who also works full time. She’s been an employee of the company for 12 years and two years ago completed an online MBA program that she felt would help her career. Diane generally puts in 45 hours per week and sometimes attends to issues on weekends. She has recently been promoted to senior manager, replacing a man in that position. The new position included a raise in salary to  $76,242. The raise is at the bottom end of what she heard informally the position could pay, but is unsure how to actually find out and feels she’d rather focus on her new position than cause waves over finding out what her predecessor made.  In fact, the male senior manager was paid $94,650 when he started the same position with roughly the same experience as she has. "
